# TOOL1_FINAL_PROJECT

## Compare 2020 State/Territory Deaths To 2020 Lockdown Measures
A project written in Python to compare state/territory deaths to state/territory lockdown measures.

## Details
The Coronavirus transmission started spreading throughout the United States in January of 2020.
This project analyzes deaths across the United States beginning in the year 2015 and ending in
the year 2020. The number of deaths are calculated for total deaths per year, total deaths by
cause per year, and total deaths by cause for all six years. There are visualization graphs that
make it easier to visualize the differences of the observed data. This project then takes data
that shows the lockdown measures that each state/territory took during the year 2020 of the
COVID-19 pandemic and compares the data to the 2020 deaths data and analyzes it as one dataset
to examine if there is a relationship between the number of deaths per year per state/territory
and the lockdown measures that each state/territory took, including mask mandates.
